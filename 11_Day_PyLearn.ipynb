    "#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: \n",
    "#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/\n",
    "#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: \n",
    "#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run\n",
    "\n",
    "#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: \n",
    "#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF\n",
    "#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: \n",
    "#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt\n",

    "#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.\n",
    "#11 is the Ace.\n",

    "#user_cards = []\n",
    "#computer_cards = []\n",
    "\n",
    "#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input \n",
    "#and returns the score. \n",
    "#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.\n",
